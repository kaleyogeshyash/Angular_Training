                    <p>Vallabhbhai Patel, in full Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, byname Sardar Patel (Hindi: “Leader
                        Patel”), (born October 31, 1875, Nadiad, Gujarat, India—died December 15, 1950, Bombay [now
                        Mumbai]), Indian barrister and statesman, one of the leaders of the Indian National Congress
                        during the struggle for Indian independence. During the first three years of Indian independence
                        after 1947, he served as deputy prime minister, minister of home affairs, minister of
                        information, and minister of states.</p>

                    <p>Patel was born into a self-sufficient landowning family of the Leva Patidar caste. Reared in an
                        atmosphere of traditional Hinduism, he attended primary school at Karamasad and high school at
                        Petlad but was mainly self-taught. Patel married at the age of 16, matriculated at 22, and
                        passed the district pleader’s examination, which enabled him to practice law. In 1900 he set up
                        an independent office of district pleader in Godhra, and two years later he moved to Borsad.</p>

                    <p>As a lawyer, Patel distinguished himself in presenting an unassailable case in a precise manner
                        and in challenging police witnesses and British judges. In 1908 Patel lost his wife, who had
                        borne him a son and daughter, and thereafter remained a widower. Determined to enhance his
                        career in the legal profession, Patel traveled to London in August 1910 to study at the Middle
                        Temple. There he studied diligently and passed the final examinations with high honours.</p>

                    <p>Returning to India in February 1913, he settled in Ahmadabad, rising rapidly to become the
                        leading barrister in criminal law at the Ahmadabad bar. Reserved and courteous, he was noted for
                        his superior mannerisms, his smart, English-style clothes, and his championship in bridge at
                        Ahmadabad’s fashionable Gujarat Club. He was, until 1917, indifferent to Indian political
                        activities.</p>

                    <p>In 1917 Patel found the course of his life changed after having been influenced by Mohandas K.
                        Gandhi. Patel adhered to Gandhi’s satyagraha (policy of nonviolence) insofar as it furthered the
                        Indian struggle against the British. But he did not identify himself with Gandhi’s moral
                        convictions and ideals, and he regarded Gandhi’s emphasis on their universal application as
                        irrelevant to India’s immediate political, economic, and social problems. Nevertheless, having
                        resolved to follow and support Gandhi, Patel changed his style and appearance. He quit the
                        Gujarat Club, dressed in the white cloth of the Indian peasant, and ate in the Indian manner.
                    </p>

                    <p>From 1917 to 1924 Patel served as the first Indian municipal commissioner of Ahmadabad and was
                        its elected municipal president from 1924 to 1928. Patel first made his mark in 1918, when he
                        planned mass campaigns of peasants, farmers, and landowners of Kaira, Gujarat, against the
                        decision of the Bombay government to collect the full annual revenue taxes despite crop failures
                        caused by heavy rains.</p>

                    <p>In 1928 Patel successfully led the landowners of Bardoli in their resistance against increased
                        taxes. His efficient leadership of the Bardoli campaign earned him the title sardar (“leader”),
                        and henceforth he was acknowledged as a nationalist leader throughout India. He was considered
                        practical, decisive, and even ruthless, and the British recognized him as a dangerous enemy.</p>
